  Picture this: a bustling fashion ecommerce and affiliate marketing site, teeming with stylish 
  clothing, shoes, and accessories. But despite the website's appeal, something was missing. The 
  customer conversion rates were lackluster, leaving the company's owners scratching their heads.
  <br><br>
  Enter piste.ai, a data consulting firm with a mission to transform businesses through data 
  strategy and AI/ML solutions. The fashion ecommerce site knew they needed a data makeover, and 
  piste.ai was just the team to make it happen.
  <br><br>
  In less than three months, piste.ai got to work. They reimagined the site's data architecture, 
  bringing it up to modern standards and ensuring that valuable insights were no longer trapped in 
  silos. But that wasn't enough. The team knew they needed to do more to boost customer engagement 
  and sales.
  <br><br>
  So, they deployed a cutting-edge AI recommender system that quickly became the secret sauce to the
  fashion site's success. With tailored product recommendations, customers felt seen and heard, and
  they were more likely to make a purchase. And the results were stunning - a 35% increase in
  conversions.
