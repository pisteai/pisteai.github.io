title : "Customer Story: Personalizing Fashion"
content: >
  Picture this: a bustling fashion ecommerce and affiliate marketing site, teeming with stylish 
  clothing, shoes, and accessories. But despite the website's appeal, something was missing. The 
  customer conversion rates were lackluster, leaving the company's owners scratching their heads.
  <br><br>
  As a data consulting firm specializing in data strategy and AI/ML solutions, we knew we had the 
  expertise to make a difference. We were excited to take on the challenge and transform the
  site using the power of data.
  <br><br>
  We got to work immediately, and within just three months, we completely transformed the site's 
  data architecture, bringing it up to modern standards and ensuring that valuable insights were no 
  longer trapped in silos.
  <br><br>
  But we knew that wasn't enough. To truly boost customer engagement and sales, we needed to go 
  above and beyond. That's why we deployed a cutting-edge AI recommender system that quickly became
  the secret sauce to the fashion site's success. With tailored product recommendations, customers 
  felt seen and heard, and they were more likely to make a purchase.
  <br><br>
  For us at piste.ai, this success story is just one example of our passion for using data to 
  transform businesses and achieve real-world results.
