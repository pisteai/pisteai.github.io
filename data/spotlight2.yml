  When we partnered with a major defense prime contractor, we knew we had our work cut out for us.
  Their culture was far from data-driven, and they needed help to make the shift.
  <br><br>
  But we were up for the challenge. In just six short months, we were able to hire a diverse team of
  incredible data engineers, data scientists, and data analysts. These talented individuals were 
  exactly what the client needed to start turning data into tangible business 
  results.
  <br><br>
  And the results were impressive. We saw decision making become more efficient, more accurate, and
  more effective. We watched as the team became more empowered to take risks, knowing that their 
  decisions were backed by data-driven insights.
  <br><br>
  But most importantly, we watched as the culture of the company began to shift. Data-driven 
  decision making was no longer a foreign concept, but an integral part of their everyday 
  operations. For us at piste.ai, this was a success story that we were proud to be a part of, 
  and a testament to the transformative power of data.
